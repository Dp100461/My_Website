  <h1 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"The solar system</h1>
  
 
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun,-the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,<br>
    Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets,<br>
    and meteoroids.</p>
 
 
 
    
  <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">The Sun</h2>
  
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">In the center of the solar system is a star,The Sun is a yellow dwarf star,<br>
    a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its gravity holds<br> 
    everything from the biggest planets to tiny debris in its orbit.</p>

  
  <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Mercury</h2>
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight<br>
    would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that<br>
    title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere</p>
 
 
  <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Venus</h2>
 
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. <br>
    A thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect,<br>
    making it the hottest planet in our solar system.</p>
  
  
   <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Earth</h2>

  
   <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Earth—our home planet—is the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.<br>
     It's also the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.</p>

  
   <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Mars.</h2>

  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.<br>
    There is strong evidence Mars was—billions of years ago—wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere.</p>

  <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Jupiter</h2>
  
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Jupiter is more than twice as massive than the other planets of our solar system combined.<br>
    The giant planet's Great Red spot is a centuries-old storm bigger than Earth.</p>
  
  <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Saturn</h2>
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Adorned with a dazzling, complex system of icy rings, Saturn is unique in our solar system.<br>
    The other giant planets have rings, but none are as spectacular as Saturn's.</p>

  
 
  
  <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Uranus</h2>
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Uranus—seventh planet from the Sun—rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit.<br>
    This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side.</p>
  
  <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Neptune</h2>
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Neptune—the eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our Sun—is dark,<br>
    cold and whipped by supersonic winds. It was the first planet located through mathematical calculations,<br>
    rather than by telescope</p>
