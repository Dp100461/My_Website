  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun,-the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,<br>
    Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets,<br>
    and meteoroids.</p>
 
 
 
    
  <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">The Sun</h2>
  
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">In the center of the solar system is a star,The Sun  is a yellow dwarf star,<br>
    a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its gravity holds<br> 
    everything from the biggest planets to tiny debris in its orbit.</p>

  
  <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Mercury</h2>
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight<br>
    would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that<br>
    title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere</p>
 
 
  <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Venus</h2>
 
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. <br>
    A thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect,<br>
    making it the hottest planet in our solar system.</p>
  
  
   <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Earth</h2>

  
   <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Earth—our home planet—is the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.<br>
     It's also the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.</p>

  
   <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Mars.</h2>

  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.<br>
    There is strong evidence Mars was—billions of years ago—wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere.</p>
