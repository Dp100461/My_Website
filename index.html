  <h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">The Solar System!</h1>

  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Our solar system consists of <em>our star,</em> the Sun-the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,<br> 
  Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto dozens of moons and millions of asteroids,
  <br> comets, and meteoroids.</p>

    <h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">The Sun</h2>
  <p style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">In the center of the solar system is a star,The Sun  is a yellow dwarf star,<br>
    a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its gravity holds<br> 
    everything from the biggest planets to tiny debris in its orbit.</p>
  
  <h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Mercury</h2>
  
  <p style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight<br>
    would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system â€“ that<br>
    title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere</p>
 
  
  <h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Venus</h2>
  
  <p style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. <br>
    A thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect,<br>
    making it the hottest planet in our solar system.</p>
