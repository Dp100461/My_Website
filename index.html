<h1>The Solar System!</h1>
  
  <p>
  Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity
    – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; 
    dwarf planets such as Pluto dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. 
  </p>
  <h2>The Sun</h2>
  <P>In the center of the universe is a star,The Sun  is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system.
   Its gravity holds everything from the biggest planets to tiny debris in its orbit. </p>
  
  <p>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight
    would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that
    title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.</p>
